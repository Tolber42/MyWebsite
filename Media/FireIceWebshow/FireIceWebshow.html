My passion for modeling and acting has been there since the young age of 8. When I was 10, I began acting in school plays and was very active in all aspects the Arts and Theater programs in my community. When I turned 16, I became even more serious and took acting and modeling classes at The State of Michigan's Academy of Creative Artistic Productions, LLC. During my acting and modeling classes, I learned all the aspects of the industry and graduated within the <a href="#"> Fire and Ice Twitter</a> and certification program as a professional. I did so well, that I am currently represented by Your Entourage Agency, Inc. and the Academy as one of their professional paid models. Since then, I have been pursuing my career in fashion and in film.  I am very active in my community, helping out where I can, and I am a firm believer in good health. As a former athlete, I participate in cheer leading, basketball, track, and exercises my brain on the robotics team! I am an active member of the Detroit YMCA "I Can Achieve Program". I participate in all these activities while maintaining a 3.8 grade point average. I am very hardworking and ambitious young lady that is a successful model and actress.
