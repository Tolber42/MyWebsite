As a college student, it is easy to fall into a pattern of poor lifestyle habits. The constant stress of balancing classes and a social life can take a toll on eating, sleeping, and fitness habits-or lack of fitness thereof. That is why this book is a guide to prevent students from falling into this easy yet unhealthy lifestyle and reverse those who may have already been trapped. 

The title of the book says How to Gain the Freshman 15 Of Muscle, but that does not necessarily mean that this book is a guide to only gaining weight. This book is a guide on eating healthy, losing, maintaining, and gaining weight, turning body fat into muscle, and working out all while maintaining the balance of classes and a social life. This book is flexible to cater to your personal needs and goals. All you have to do is be willing to make a lifestyle change of building new habits. 

So the ultimate question this book will help you answer is… Do I want to gain the “freshman 15” of muscle? Or the “freshman 15” of fat? The choice is yours!
