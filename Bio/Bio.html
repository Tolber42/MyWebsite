Arielle Tolbert is an ambitious, hardworking, and talented young woman from Southfield, Michigan. She loves to give her all in anything she sets her mind to and be involved in her community. She has the knowledge, perseverance, and passion to reach the next level and will do whatever it takes to achieve all of her dreams.
<br>
<br>
She is currently a student at Michigan State University, where she studies Computer Engineering. She has always had a passion for computers, but her love for technology is incomparable to her love for acting and modeling.  Arielle Tolbert has been modeling and acting for years, but did not get serious about this passion until she was 16. She enrolled in Michigan’s Academy of Creative Artistic Production’s modeling and acting class. From there, her love for the acting and modeling industry grew even more as she became more confortable in front of the camera and on the runway, all while gaining professional experience. Since then, Arielle is actively involved in Michigan State’s theatre program and is constantly seeking to enhance her talents and desires.
<br>
<br>
Recently, Arielle Tolbert has sought to use her talents and skills to create and co-host a new Michigan State University web show called <a style="color: #404040; font-weight: bold;" href="/Users/rel5897/Documents/MyWebsite/Media/Media.html">“Fire & Ice Conversations”</a>. On there she works side-by-side with her co-host to plan, promote, host, and edit each episode. The web show aims to focus on tackling conflicting topics within the community and bring awareness to issues that are often overlooked.
<br>
<br>
Arielle’s ambitions do not stop there! She is also very involved in heath and fitness within her community. Not only is she passionate about maintaining a healthy lifestyle for herself she also loves to inspire others to lead a healthy lifestyle as well. She is a certified personal trainer and group fitness leader.
<br>
<br>
As a firm believer in good health and public service, Arielle is actively involved at the Detroit Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). From the age of 14, Arielle has been positively impacted by the many programs that the YMCA has offered to her, which drives her to give back to those who so effortlessly gave to her. The YMCA has become Arielle’s second home because of how close she has become to those within that community and the inspiration so many there have had on her life. Arielle aims to impact other young adults, the way that so many have impacted her within her involvement at the YMCA and in the YMCA’s “I Can Achieve Program,” by constantly providing a helping hand to the organization, inspiring the youth to believe in themselves and work hard for their dreams, and serving as a role model to young women.
